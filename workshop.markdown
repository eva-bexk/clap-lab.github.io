title: HumanCLAIM Workshop
description: The Human Perspective on Cross-Lingual AI Models
---

## Motivation
Linguistic diversity is one of the fundamental rights of the European Union and we are optimistic that cross-lingual AI models can play an important role in facilitating it. Cross-lingual models based on neural networks are trained on terabytes of data and have recently reached large performance gains. As the computationally expensive training of such models can only be afforded by large companies, the evaluation of cross-lingual models is driven by commercial incentives and focuses on the average quantitative performance across more than a hundred languages. The intricacies of application scenarios for low-resource languages or economically insignificant purposes are largely being overlooked and individual differences between users are underestimated. When we want to use cross-lingual models for human-centered scenarios such as cognitive modeling, language education, or use cases in the digital humanities, we quickly encounter their limitations. 

In this workshop, we want to bring together leading scholars from linguistics, cognitive science, and computer science to develop a more diverse and human-centered perspective on cross-lingual models.  We want to integrate typological theories about differences between language families, cognitive models of multilingual processing, and computational approaches toward increasing diversity in language technology.

## Important Details
Date: March 26th to March 27th, 2025 <br>
Location: G√∂ttingen, Germany

Participation in the workshop is free of charge but the number of participants is limited. <br>

# **Program Highlights**  

## **Keynote Speakers**  
We are thrilled to announce two keynote presentations:  

- **[Debora Nozza](https://www.deboranozza.com/)** (Bocconi University, Milano)  
  *Topic:* *Subjectivity in NLP and Cross-Lingual Hate Speech*  
  Debora Nozza will present her ERC-funded project focusing on subjectivity in NLP and discuss her research on cross-lingual hate speech detection.  

- **[Yuval Pinter](https://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~pintery/)** (Ben-Gurion University of the Negev)  
  *Topic:* *Challenges in Tokenization Across Languages*  
  Yuval Pinter will explore tokenization challenges in multiple languages and their impact on what models can learn.  

## **Interactive Sessions**  
- **Poster Session** ‚Äì A great opportunity for participants to present their work and receive feedback.  
- **Idea Pitches** ‚Äì Have an idea but need expertise? Join focused small-group discussions to exchange knowledge.  
- **Workshop Dinner** ‚Äì Continuing our tradition of fostering personal interaction, we organize a social dinner on Wednesday evening.
